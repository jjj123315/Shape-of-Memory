## Large-scale Data Analysis and Processing
The analysis results run through Python are often exported in CSV or JSON file formats, and these results frequently serve as inputs for another analysis process. Therefore, organizing file data, confirming corresponding column names, or further processing the obtained results to make them suitable for the next workflow are important steps in the research process. With the assistance of Python, the time spent processing data can be reduced, and accuracy can be increased. Below are some methods I frequently use in this research to help manage data workflows:
1. **Averaging the results of multiple data entries**

In spatial analysis, data is typically divided into analysis results and geographic location information, allowing us to visualize the research findings on maps. In large datasets, it is common to encounter multiple data entries corresponding to the same geographic location. In such cases, we need to organize the data and obtain an average value or mode. This method enables quick data processing and result output, with each result corresponding to a geographic coordinate (latitude and longitude) on the map. The processed file can be directly imported into software such as QGIS for mapping.
You will need to install the pandas library in your running environment first.
```
pip install pandas
 ```

2. **Classify data with the same content in a specific column**

Classify each piece of data based on the content of a specific column, and store them in corresponding folders with matching names, making it easier to analyze data in a specific direction.

*Use ```pandas``` and ```shutil```*

3. **Categorize data with similar characteristics**

Sometimes, we only perform specific analysis on certain fields in the data, and the output may not necessarily be text. After multiple analyses, the data may have been reclassified and sorted. In order to match the results with other columns of the original data and reference them against each other, I use Python code to integrate various results for later comparison and final presentation.Integrating and reordering data with similar characteristics (such as corresponding to the same geographical location) can speed up data analysis and reading.
