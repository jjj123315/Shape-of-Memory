## Large-scale Data Analysis and Processing
The analysis results run through Python are often exported in CSV or JSON file formats, and these results frequently serve as inputs for another analysis process. Therefore, organizing file data, confirming corresponding column names, or further processing the obtained results to make them suitable for the next workflow are important steps in the research process. With the assistance of Python, the time spent processing data can be reduced, and accuracy can be increased. Below are some methods I frequently use in this research to help manage data workflows:
1. **Averaging the results of multiple data entries**
In spatial analysis, data is typically divided into analysis results and geographic location information, allowing us to visualize the research findings on maps. In large datasets, it is common to encounter multiple data entries corresponding to the same geographic location. In such cases, we need to organize the data and obtain an average value or mode. This method enables quick data processing and result output, with each result corresponding to a geographic coordinate (latitude and longitude) on the map. The processed file can be directly imported into software such as QGIS for mapping.
```
pip install pandas
 ```
